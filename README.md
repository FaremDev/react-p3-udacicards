# UdaciCards

This project is my implementation of the third project of Udacity's "React" Nanodegree program.

It is a simple flashcards app : the user is able to create as many Decks as needed, each Deck holding a title and Cards (a Card being a question and its answer). 

The aim of the app is to help the user memorizing things. To that end, they can start a Quiz for each deck, to see if they are able to remember the answers to the questions.

**This app is built with React Native (Expo). It has only been tested on Android (5, 8 and 10) and I do not guarantee its behaviour on iOS devices. **

## Installation

Installation is simple and can be done through npm or Yarn.

`git clone https://github.com/FaremDev/react-p3-udacicards.git`

`yarn install OR npm install`

`yarn start OR npm start OR expo start`

Then, you'll be able to launch it through the Expo app.
